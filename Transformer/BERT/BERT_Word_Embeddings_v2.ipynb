    "\n",
    "2018 was a breakthrough year in NLP. Transfer learning, particularly models like Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT, and Google's BERT allowed researchers to smash multiple benchmarks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning and provided the rest of the NLP community with pretrained models that could easily (with less data and less compute time) be fine-tuned and implemented to produce state of the art results. Unfortunately, for many starting out in NLP and even for some experienced practicioners, the theory and practical application of these powerful models is still not well understood.\n"

    "### What is BERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), released in late 2018, is the model we will use in this tutorial to provide readers with a better understanding of and practical guidance for using transfer learning models in NLP. BERT is a method of pretraining language representations that was used to create models that NLP practicioners can then download and use for free. You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce state of the art predictions.\n"
   ]
  },

   },
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "### Why BERT embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use BERT to extract features, namely word and sentence embedding vectors, from text data. What can we do with these word and sentence embedding vectors? First, these embeddings are useful for keyword/search expansion, semantic search and information retrieval. For example, if you want to match customer questions or searches against already answered questions or well documented searches, these representations will help you accuratley retrieve results matching the customer's intent and contextual meaning, even if there's no keyword  or phrase overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, and perhaps more importantly, these vectors are used as high-quality feature inputs to downstream models. NLP models such as LSTMs or CNNs require inputs in the form of numerical vectors, and this typically means translating features like the vocabulary and parts of speech into numerical representations. In the past, words have been represented either as uniquely indexed values (one-hot encoding), or more helpfully as neural word embeddings where vocabulary words are matched against the fixed-length feature embeddings that result from models like Word2Vec or Fasttext. BERT offers an advantage over models like Word2Vec, because while each word has a fixed representation under Word2Vec regardless of the context within which the word appears, BERT produces word representations that are dynamically informed by the words around them. For example, given two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The man was accused of robbing a bank.\"\n",
    "\"The man went fishing by the bank of the river.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec would produce the same word embedding for the word \"bank\" in both sentences, while under BERT the word embedding for \"bank\" would be different for each sentence. Aside from capturing obvious differences like polysemy, the context-informed word embeddings capture other forms of information that result in more accurate feature representations, which in turn results in better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an educational standpoint, a close examination of BERT word embeddings is a good way to get  your feet wet with BERT and its family of transfer learning models, and sets us up with some practical knowledge and context to better understand the inner details of the model in later tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Onward!"

    "\n",
    "Why does it look this way? This is because the BERT tokenizer was created with a WordPiece model. This model greedily creates a fixed-size vocabulary of individual characters, subwords, and words that best fits our language data. Since the vocabulary limit size of our BERT tokenizer model is 30,000, the WordPiece model generated a vocabulary that contains all English characters plus the ~30,000 most common words and subwords found in the English language corpus the model is trained on. This vocabulary contains four things:\n",

    "4. Individual characters\n",

If not, it tries to break the word into the largest possible subwords contained in the vocabulary, and as a last resort will decompose the word into individual characters. Note that because of this, we can always represent a word as, at the very least, the collection of its individual characters.\n",
    "\n",

    "So, rather than assigning \"embeddings\" and every other out of vocabulary word to an overloaded unknown vocabulary token, we split it into subword tokens ['em', '##bed', '##ding', '##s'] that will retain some of the contextual meaning of the original word.

    "1. The embeddings start out in the first layer as having no contextual information (i.e., the meaning of the initial 'bank' embedding isn't specific to river bank or financial bank).\n",
    "2. As the embeddings move deeper into the network, they pick up more and more contextual information with each layer.\n",
    "3. As you approach the final layer, however, you start picking up information that is specific to BERT's pre-training tasks (the \"Masked Language Model\" (MLM) and \"Next Sentence Prediction\" (NSP)). \n",
    "    * What we want is embeddings that encode the word meaning well... \n",
    "    * BERT is motivated to do this, but it is also motivated to encode anything else that would help it determine what a missing word is (MLM), or whether the second sentence came after the first (NSP). \n",

This allows wonderful things like polysemy so that e.g. your representation encodes river \"bank\" and not a financial institution \"bank\",  but makes direct word-to-word similarity comparisons less valuable. However, for sentence embeddings similarity comparison is still valid such that one can query, for example, a single sentence against a dataset of other sentences in order to find the most similar. Depending on the similarity metric used, the resulting similarity values will be less informative than the relative ranking of similarity outputs since many similarity metrics make assumptions about the vector space (equally-weighted dimensions, for example) that do not hold for our 768-dimensional vector space.\n"
