    "Transformer architecture was introduced as a novel pure attention-only sequence-to-sequence architecture by Vaswani et al.[Attention is all you need](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf). Its ability for parallelizable training and its general performance improvement made it a popular option among NLP (and recently CV) researchers."

    "Position and order of words are the essential parts of any language. They define the grammar and thus the actual semantics of a sentence. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) inherently take the order of word into account; They parse a sentence word by wThe first idea that might come to mind is to assign a number to each time-step within the [0, 1] range in which 0 means the first word and 1 is the last time-step. Could you figure out what kind of issues it would cause? One of the problems it will introduce is that you can’t figure out how many words are present within a specific range. In other words, time-step delta doesn’t have consistent meaning across different sentences.ord in a sequential manner. This will integrate the words’ order in the backbone of RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the Transformer architecture ditched the recurrence mechanism in favor of multi-head self-attention mechanism. Avoiding the RNNs’ method of recurrence will result in massive speed-up in the training time. And theoretically, it can capture longer dependencies in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As each word in a sentence simultaneously flows through the Transformer’s encoder/decoder stack, The model itself doesn’t have any sense of position/order for each word. Consequently, there’s still the need for a way to incorporate the order of the words into our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution to give the model some sense of order is to add a piece of information to each word about its position in the sentence. We call this “piece of information”, the positional encoding.\n",

In other words, time-step delta doesn’t have consistent meaning across different sentences.\n",

    "Another idea is to assign a number to each time-step linearly. That is, the first word is given “1”, the second word is given “2”, and so on. The problem with this approach is that not only the values could get quite large, but also our model can face sentences longer than the ones in training. In addition, our model may not see any sample with one specific length which would hurt generalization of our model.\n",
