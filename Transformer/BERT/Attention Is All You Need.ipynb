We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model's weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output.`\n",

Notice that every position gets a little bit of probability even if it's unlikely to be the output of that time step -- that's a very useful property of softmax which helps the training process.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because the model produces the outputs one at a time, we can assume that the model is selecting the word with the __highest probability__ from that probability distribution and throwing away the rest. That’s one way to do it (__called greedy decoding__). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to do it would be to hold on to, say, the __top two words__ (say, ‘I’ and ‘a’ for example), then in the next step, __run the model twice__: once assuming the first output position was the word ‘I’, and another time assuming the first output position was the word ‘a’, and whichever version produced less error considering both positions #1 and #2 is kept. We repeat this for positions #2 and #3…etc. This method is called __“beam search”__, where in our example, beam_size was two (meaning that at all times, two partial hypotheses (unfinished translations) are kept in memory), and top_beams is also two (meaning we’ll return two translations). These are both hyperparameters that you can experiment with.\n"
